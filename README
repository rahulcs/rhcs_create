NAME            README
SUMMARY        	HOW TO USE THE RHCS CLUSTER CREATION SCRIPT
VERSION         1.0
PROGRAMMER      Rahul C S


DESCRIPTION:
	HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT TO CREATE A 4-NODE AND 2-NODE CLUSTERS ON REDHAT USING RHCS


*******************************************************************************

All logs are saved in the logs/ directory.

Make sure the nodes forming the cluster are up and ready. Install suitable failover driver and Storage Manager client installed on the node from where the cluster is being created.


*******************************************************************************

1) Host IPs
	- Enter the Host IPs of the nodes forming the cluster.


2) Virtual IPs 
	- Virtual IP addresses for the creation of cluster.
		Number of IPs depending on the number of nodes present in the cluster.

3) MPP Error Level
	- Defines mpp's errorlevel (0,1,2,or 3), the lower the number, 
	  the more mpp debug information will be printed to 
	  /var/log/messages

4) Harness IP
	- Harness host IP used to mount volumes from the cluster nodes.
		Also used for running IO.



*******************************************************************************

Directory Structure:

rhcs_create.zip -

After untarring the zip, there will be a directory and exactly 1 executable.

Executables:

clus_rhcs - The file contains the variables and functions required for the creation of cluster.
	    The executable specifically asks the user the required number of nodes.
	    Right now the script supports only 2 and 4 nodes.

Directories:

logs		- This directory contains nothing initially. Any logs associated with clus_rhcs.sh are contained here


Files:

cluster4.conf 	- The file is specifically a template for the 4-node cluster.conf file. The clus_rhcs script sed's the
		  cluster4.conf and then copies its output into /etc/cluster/ directory.

cluster.conf 	- The file is specifically a template for the 2-node cluster.conf file. After editing the file
		  it is copied into the /etc/cluster/ directory.	

exports		- The exports file stores the harness IP the user keys in and copies it into /etc/

testutils.conf 	- The file contains variable values for the cluster creation, and has been only used as a reference.


*******************************************************************************

HOW TO:

extract rhcs_create.zip -
	unzip rhcs_create.zip
	This command will create a collection of files and directories.
	
	NOTE: You must have SMclient and a relevant driver in order to run IO.
		It is suggested that a multipath failover driver is installed 
		as well.

start creating the cluster resources - 
	From the shell run clus_rhcs.sh script and keyin appropriate values
	
	./clus_rhcs
